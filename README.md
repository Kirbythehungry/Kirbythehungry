## 🪞 -- Hey there, hello I'm Kirby, I go by Kirb and a couple other names.
● I identify myself as having multiple personalities, that I will not disclose (the only reason I share the fact i do is beause it causes me to act weird at times.)
● I go by all pronouns, and my gender is constantly sifting.

  ## 🪞 --I prefer to stay mostly to myself or to trust individuals online meaning I may act rude or dismissive in conversations if we're just meeting.
I choose to respect controversial identities or complicated identities, but this doesn't mean I support people under the Radqueer or right ring umbrella. If you are either please dni, otherwise you will be blocked.
Due to my personal beliefs I do not allow slurs to be said in conversation with me, this also includes reclaimed slurs as both run the risk of children learning of the words but not the past/meaning. This already has happened with the word "cult" and other such words.
